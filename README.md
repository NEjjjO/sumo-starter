Robot-sumo start module
=====================
Visit http://www.startmodule.com for information of how the start module system works.

This page is mainly for those who are interested in the sourcecode and schematics of the start module.

As the old repo has not been updated in years, I took up on myself to update it with new PCB files that are panelised and easy to create and program at home.
Future update incoming!

IR Remote Schematics will be uploaded soon!

Purpose
====================
The purpose of this git repository is to maintain the robot-sumo start module system which is an open source and open hardware project.
The purpose of the module is to make robot-sumo matches more fair and less time consuming by eliminating the possibilites of false starts.
This is done by each robot having a receiver(start module) that are programmed to suply the robot with at start signal when the referee sends the signal via an IR-remote.
